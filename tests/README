This file contains various python scripts for testing SOAPpy.

Type "make" to run the tests. You can specify which Python interpreter
to run the tests with, e.g. "make PYTHON=python2.5".

All of the tests here work without generating errors EXCEPT:

- SOAPtest.py  

    Fails the 'testArray' test because 'referenced' elements are
    included in the return object.  This is a known shortcoming of
    SOAPpy and is on the future features list. All other tests pass.

- storageTest.py

    Fails because the hard-coded user/password combination is no
    longer valid.

- translateTest.py 

    Fails (gracefully) with a message that the service is no longer
    available.

- excelTest.py

    Fails because the EXCEL service is not available.

- testClient1.py 

    This is experimental code for making unit tests that depend on
    running both a client and a server process.  It failse because the
    code doesn't quite manage to get the server started up for the second
    test.  This is a problem with the test, not with SOAPpy, but we
    intend to get it fixed so that we can create better unit tests.

The test files which rely on no-longer available servers should be
removed unless we can find a replacement. This will wait for a cleanup
associated with release of version 1.0.

Also note that serveral of the client tests need to have the
corresponding server running:

	Client			Server
	----------------------  ------------------------
	cardClient.py		cardServer.py
	echoClient.py		echoServer.py
	echoHeader.py		echoServer.py
	esj_test_client.py	esj_test_server.py
	largeDataTest.py	echoServer.py
	speedTest.py		echoServer.py

Of course, tests which rely on access to an external URL require that
the web is accessible.  If you are behind a firewall, try setting the
http_proxy environment variable to the URL of your web proxy.
