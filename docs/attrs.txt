Using SOAPpy Attributes
=======================

All SOAPpy data classes implement methods to access and mutate
individual attributes.

The _setAttr method has as parameters a 'tag', the attribute name, and the 
value to which the attribute should be set.

The _getAttrs method simply has the 'tag' parameter.
