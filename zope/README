Using SOAP with ZOPE
--------------------

 We can use Zope to provide web services. The first is to support SOAP like
 XML-RPC. There are two patches for Zope 2.5.0 version and for Zope 2.6.2
 version. To apply the path, you only need to do:

 $ cd <your home zope directory>
 $ patch -p1 < /<patch directory>/zope-2.6.2-soappy.diff

 You need to install SOAPpy and fpconst. You can download this two packages
 from here:

 http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywebsvcs
 http://software.biostat.washington.edu/statsoft/snake/fpconst/

 If you are using the precompiled version of Zope, you need to add the path
 to the PYTHONPATH environment variable to specify where this packages
 lives.
 To do this, add a line like this to your start script:

 export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/

 Note: This can be dangerous because in your machine you are using several
 versions of python.
